					<p>It seems to be a tradition to write a cheesy ðŸ§€ blog post after you&#39;ve earned your OSCP, here
						I am.
						TLDR:
						<ul>
							<li>Laughed at people calling it a &#39;journey&#39;</li>
							<li>Failed, reconsidered the whole &#39;journey&#39; thing</li>
							<li>Got more motivation from failing than ever before</li>
							<li>Passed</li>
						</ul>

					</p>
					<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
					<p>I&#39;m a Software Engineer by trade, worked in companies large and small, worked with super old
						tech, and the shiny new stuff on the cloud, <em>serverless</em> <em>typescript</em>
						<em>functional programming</em> and a bunch more buzzwords. As a naive 14 year old I always
						wanted to become a super l33t hax0r. Slightly forgot that dream for a while, but after 10 years
						in the Software Field I really needed some kind of change. Long story short, I stumbled on the
						OSCP and liked the concept a lot. A course that teaches you ethical hacking! Sounds fun!</p>
					<p>&quot;Let&#39;s just try it, how hard can it be?&quot; - I thought to myself and just went and
						purchased the PWK Course. </p>
					<h2 id="starting-out">Starting out</h2>
					<p>I spent a while reading the PWK PDF and actually learned a lot more than I expected. There is a
						lot of fun stuff in there (Did you know <a
							href="http://www.powershellempire.com/">PowerShellEmpire</a> let&#39;s you <a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rick-Roll</a> people?). I also purchased
						a subscription to HackTheBox (which I liked primarily because you need to do a challenge to even
						create an account). Doing the starting path and easy boxes with a lot of watching <a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec/videos">ippsec&#39;s videos</a> to understand the
						basics. This really helped me a ton in the beginning. I&#39;ve heard a lot of good things about
						the rooms in TryHackMe as well, but personally I did not use this platform. Cracking some of the
						non-retired machines on HackTheBox (no writeups available for these) felt damn good!</p>
					<p>I only purchased 30 days of the PWK Lab time, which had almost ran out by the time I finished the
						PDF, so I only got the recommended starting point machines done, before the time ran out. Still
						highly recommend starting out with these in the lab, as they also mention which chapters are
						covered by these machines.</p>
					<p>After my lab time ran out, I&#39;ve used <a
							href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/">TJNulls
							list for OSCP-like boxes</a> and did most of the HackTheBox ones. As I had the HackTheBox
						VIP subscription, I was able to look up writeups much more easily and could learn a lot from the
						masters. This also had the caveat, that it is easy to get into the habit of just looking up the
						solution once you get stuck (At least set yourself a timer to try for 2h+ before
						&#39;cheating&#39;, you&#39;ll learn much more like this.).</p>
					<h2 id="first-exam-try">First exam try</h2>
					<p>Once I did most of the HackTheBox machines from the google sheet, I felt quite ready to take on
						the exam. I was able to do most easy/medium machines without looking up the solution in a
						reasonable amount of time.
						So I signed up, and also did some Vulnhub machines, the OSCP VulnApps buffer overflows to
						prepare for the 25pt Buffer Overflow machine in the lab.</p>
					<p>My exam was scheduled to start at 4 PM, I was so nervous that I slept really bad the night before
						and already felt sluggish. During the setup phase, you&#39;re expected to run a diagnostics
						script to verify your VPN connection. It had some issue with my DNS, so I needed to troubleshoot
						that. The proctors told me it looks like I was connecting from a datacenter. After turning off
						my Pi-Hole and proving to them that I was connected to a residential connection, I was even more
						nervous than before and already lost a good hour of exam time.</p>
					<p>I read a lot about strategies on what to tackle first, so I did what most people recommended:
						Doing the buffer overflow machine first and letting <a
							href="https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon">AutoRecon</a> run in the background for all the
						other hosts. <em>Always be scanning is a good word of wisdom</em> </p>
					<p>After struggling a bit to make the buffer overflow work on the target machine (needed to revert
						it before it would work), still extremely nervous, I set out to try my first 20 point machine.
						After about 20min I was pretty sure I found a vulnerability that would let me exploit it, none
						of my attempts seemed to actually work. It just would not budge. </p>
					<p>This is where I committed my next big mistake, I kept coming back to that damn 20 pointer,
						hopping between boxes as soon as I got another Idea. So I barely touched my 10 point machine or
						the other 20 pointer.
						I also didn&#39;t really take any breaks, I always felt like I was sooooo close!</p>
					<p>After switching to the 25 pointer, I found a vulnerability pretty fast, but exploiting it seemed
						impossible again, I tried a lot of techniques. Techniques that were way out of scope for the
						OSCP (that should&#39;ve been an indication that I was on the wrong path).
						This viscous cycle continued for all the other boxes. I found the attack vector, but just could
						not follow through at all. Even the 10 pointer seemed like a cruel joke. After I slept a
						horrible 5 hours, already thinking to myself that I must&#39;ve failed, I reemerged and tried a
						bunch of more stuff that I could think of.</p>
					<p>Still. Nothing.</p>
					<p>It was extremely frustrating. I had run out of ideas on what to try. I ran metasploit against one
						machine, but that did not help me at all. After calming down a bit and going on a walk, I still
						did not have any ðŸ’¡ turning on in my head. I tried stuff until I watched the VPN close in front
						of my eyes. I knew I failed this time.</p>
					<h2 id="prep-for-second-exam">Prep for second exam</h2>
					<p>After recovering a bit and sleeping a lot, I actually expected to be devastated, but actually the
						opposite happened. My ass was handed to me, and somehow that inspired me more than ever. I was
						so excited about learning about CyberSec I could barely go to sleep, continuing reading
						<a href="https://reddit.com/r/netsec">https://reddit.com/r/netsec</a> and hacker news in bed. It really sparked my interest more than I
						ever thought.
						So I re-purchased another Exam-Attempt and another 30 days of lab time. I built a spreadsheet
						and wanted to conquer at least 30 machines (on average 1 a day) during my lab time.</p>
					<h3 id="what-the-labs-made-different-to-htb">What the labs made different to HTB</h3>
					<p>In my opinion the labs are much more accurate in terms of real world machines. You get angry
						firewalls and AVs that you need to dodge, on HTB a lot of the time you are given &#39;quality of
						life&#39; features like <code>nc</code> binaries with the <code>-e</code> option on the
						vulnerable hosts. Not so in the PWK labs, you&#39;ll need to try a bunch of different reverse
						shells for it to work.</p>
					<p>This is an invaluable resource:</p>
					<p><a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md">swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings</a>
					</p>
					<p>The machines also won&#39;t just allow any port, you need to find out which are open and then use
						those for your shells.
						The lab contains a few hidden gems like <em>possibly</em> retired exam machines (the loot you
						find on those will indicate as such), so it&#39;s a much better approximation of what you will
						find in the exam.
						I also enjoyed the pivoting part immensely, gaining access to the &#39;hidden&#39; departments
						really felt like being a real hacker.

					</p>
					<p>The infamous big 4 were also a nice challenge and I can definitely recommend them.</p>
					<h3 id="hacktricks">Hacktricks</h3>
					<p>Hacktricks has been one of the best resources I could find so far, it has tons of guides for
						grouped by port / type of exploitation / software etc. I can highly recommend it
						<a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/">https://book.hacktricks.xyz/</a></p>
					<h3 id="proving-grounds-practice">Proving Grounds Practice</h3>
					<p>Another platform I enjoyed using during my time was <a
							href="https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/individual/">Offsec&#39;s Proving Grounds
							Practice</a> I think it is worth its $19 per month and gives you a wide variety of machines
						to exploit.
						Some gripes I had with this platform though were:
						- Writeups can only be accessed after working 1.5h on it, if you stop and continue the next day,
						this counter is reset. I understand the reasoning behind it, but I would definitely not
						recommend this platform for any kind of beginner that relies on writeups
						- Writeups can not be looked at, after rooting the machine and submitting the flags. This really
						bothered me, you have no way to learn what other methods of exploitation existed or if you used
						an unintended way of exploitation (i.e. Kernel exploit, if another vulnerability was intended)
					</p>
					<p>Proving ground practice also contained more up-to-date machines than the lab, so you&#39;d get to
						experience vulnerabilities in more modern software.
						Exploiting the machines also gives you some kind of idea what Offsec considers to be easy,
						medium and hard boxes, which can be valuable in the exam. As a software engineer I noticed as
						soon as a machine requires you to read / write code the community considers it as &#39;Very
						Hard&#39;.</p>
					<h3 id="udemy">Udemy</h3>
					<p>I also signed up the for excellent Privilege Escalation Courses on Udemy from Tib3rius. It will
						give you much more background on what LinPEAS and WinPEAS will output, which is nice to fill
						gaps in your knowledge.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation/">https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation/</a></p>
					<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation/">https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation/</a></p>
					<h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2>
					<p>Something I kind of disliked in general was the &#39;Try Harder&#39; mentality. I&#39;d see
						beginners struggling to understand a concept and only getting the famous phrase thrown at them.
						Every time someone reached out to me, I really tried to make sure they understood the underlying
						concepts. It seems like a really discouraging way to handle teaching, I&#39;ve never once met
						someone that was just looking for the solution, all of them just wanted to broaden their
						knowledge. You can&#39;t try harder, if you don&#39;t even know what to try.</p>
					<h3 id="infosec-discord-server">Infosec discord server</h3>
					<p><img src="images/discord.png" alt=""></p>
					<p>One of the best resources for me was the <a href="https://discord.gg/RRgKaep">InfoSec Prep
							Discord Server</a>. It&#39;s filled with people with the same goal as you and they are very
						helpful. Even as an introvert I noticed a big jump in motivation working with other people on
						the same goal.</p>
					<h2 id="what-i-would-do-differently-than-i-did">What I would do differently than I did</h2>
					<p>To get the most of the lab time, start with TryHackMe or other platforms more meant for teaching
						you the basics before signing up for the course. Still read the PDF you get, it&#39;s well
						written and was an enjoyable read.</p>
					<p>Don&#39;t focus on just one platform, I mostly only did HackTheBox, but boxes can be very
						similar. It&#39;s good to diversify a bit with VulnHub, HTB, TryHackMe etc.
						Hold off on Proving Grounds Practice until you already have a solid methodology built up.</p>
					<h2 id="second-exam">Second exam</h2>
					<p>A few days before the actual exam, I chose a set of 4 machines from the Proving Grounds Practice
						(1x 10pt, 2x 20ptm 1x 25pt) as well as <a
							href="https://github.com/justinsteven/dostackbufferoverflowgood">dostackbufferoverflowgood</a>.
						I set myself a time limit of 24h to finish all of those. After 5h 19min I had gained access to
						all of them and felt more confident about my second attempt.</p>
					<p>After a month of additional preparation I felt much better about being able to tackle the exam.
						My exam was scheduled for 1PM, so I went for a long walk in the sunny spring weather to calm my
						nerves and felt refreshed and ready to start.</p>
					<p>This time it went much much better. Even the harder machines seemed easy to crack and I reached
						the required 70 points (BoF, 1x25 1x20) in only 5 hours. I made dinner and then pwned the 10pt
						in about 30min. I finished up writing the report and then tried to tackle the last 20 pointer,
						but after 4 hours of trial and error I just could not crack it. I went to bed, slept 8 hours and
						finished the report the next day. Submitting the pdf 2 hours before the VPN closed.</p>
					<p>One day later I received the confirmation email that I passed ðŸŽ‰</p>
					<h2 id="final-thoughts-and-advice">Final thoughts and advice</h2>
					<h3 id="exam">Exam</h3>
					<p>Don&#39;t get too stressed, remember all the machines are meant to be exploited well within 24
						hours. If you don&#39;t make any progress in 2h allow yourself to switch to another machine,
						don&#39;t keep hopping between them this will just get you confused. During your prep you also
						didn&#39;t do that, why start now?</p>
					<h3 id="course">Course</h3>
					<p>Don&#39;t be discouraged by all the posts that you read of people failing, in general OSCP was a
						really nice journey and trains to well for the real world. There were many times I was so
						excited about pentesting that I could barely sleep. It should not feel like a chore, hacking is
						supposed to be fun!</p>
